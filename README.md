# 🛡️ Allergen Checker Browser Extension

A browser extension that scans product cards on popular grocery websites and checks them for allergens using the AI.  
Perfect for people with food allergies — or just curious minds who want to know what’s in their food 🧐

---

## ✨ Project Status
🚧 Work in progress
This project is still under development. The extension currently parses product cards on supported websites and identifies product names, but full allergen detection and API integration (Open Food Facts, OpenAI) is still in progress.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

🔧 Prerequisites  
*Coming soon — this extension is still under development and not yet published in the Chrome Web Store.*

---

## 💡 Features

✅ Scans all visible product **cards** on grocery websites (e.g. Barbora, Rimi)  
✅ Extracts product names and fetches products pages without user notice. Collects food ingridients from product pages.
✅ Uses **OpenAI** to process and verify product composition  (WIP)
✅ Highlights allergens directly on the product card  (WIP)
✅ Works without needing to open product pages — everything happens inline

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **JavaScript** – pure vanilla + browser APIs  
- **Manifest V3** – latest standard for Chrome Extensions  
- **OpenAI API** – natural language processing and fallback parsing  
- **Custom logic** for parsing dynamic product cards from different e-shops

## 🌱 Future Plans

- [ ] Add support for more grocery websites  
- [ ] Add language switching support  
- [ ] Improve accuracy of matching products  
- [ ] Optimize API usage to reduce latency and limit calls

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I wanted to explore browser extensions and learn how to interact with real websites. This project helped me:

🔹 Understand how different e-commerce sites build and structure their product cards
🔹 Practice writing modular, scalable content scripts
🔹 Plan integration with external APIs and handle user-oriented UI design

The project is not finished yet, but I'm proud of the technical foundation that shows that I'm capable of designing for real-world use.
